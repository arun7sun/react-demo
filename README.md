Hi,
This is my React Demo Project

If you are trying this for first time and haven't installed react before,Enter the following comment in your CMD (Node should be installed)
  
- npm install -g react react-dom react-scripts

After Globally installing React,
- npm install - to install dependencies into project

- npm start - command to run the project
  
*You can also refer package.json file.
